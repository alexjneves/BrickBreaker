============

My First 2D Game, written just after my first year of university.

Coming from Java the code looks very Java-like and doesn't take advantage of many C# features such as properties.
Although the code isn't of the greatest quality, it's interesting to look back and see how I've grown as a developer.
I learned a tonne from doing this side project and it gave me a good insight into simple game development.
